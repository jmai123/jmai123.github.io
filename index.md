### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because it was interesting to see a program that someone might have actually used be created. In this lab, we were also introduced to vectors, and we applied them to taking the average of a vector given user input. I found that the combination of a new concept and a program that may be used made this lab interesting.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I would say it was the first 'real game' that we programmed. The program relied heavily on user input and applied the concept of loops that we had recently learned. The use of a while loop along with the application of the distance formula (to find if the player's guess was warmer or co'der than a previous guess) made this lab interesting for me.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I learned how Blackjack worked and the use of functions made things a lot easier. Learning functions was fun because it compartmentalized different concepts we had learned previously. This lab was also interesting because through the lab I understood how blackjack scoring worked. I found this lab especially interesting because it showed how you needed to put effort/research different aspects of a program rather than just coding (a large part of this lab wasnâ€™t knowing how to do things, but rather understanding what was asked of you).
